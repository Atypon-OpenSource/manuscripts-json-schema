# General
- the ids should probably be fully resolved (http://manuscripts.io/schema/mp-section.json)
- what is a sessionID again? In the export the hardcoded id MPColors don't have a sessionID
- can preferredXHTMLElement be enumed
- `MPPageLayout` has `embeddedNumberingStyle` which is an `MPNumberingStyle`.
  - It has a `priority` and I have NFI how.

# Specific files
- definitions/
  - scalars.json
    - timestamp
      - FIX: arbitrary minimum and maximum values.

# Defintions
- Issue with numbers/strings in output.
